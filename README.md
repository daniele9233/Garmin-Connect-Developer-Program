# Garmin-Connect-Developer-Program


I am an independent developer and I would like to use the Garmin Connect Developer Program for personal projects and learning purposes.
My goal is to connect my own Garmin device with small experimental applications that I develop, in order to better understand the API and manage my personal activity data.
This is for non-commercial and personal use only.
